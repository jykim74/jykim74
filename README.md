- 👋 Hi, I’m jykim74 and I am korean.
- 👀 I’m interested in PKI programs and I have developed these programs with Openssl3 and QT.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing PKI programs in private time and I am working in company too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to upgrade these PKI programs. Currently, my company is not affiliated with the PKI program.
- 📫 I hope to work with company or people to need these PKI programs.
- If you want to contact to me, mail to me. My mail is jykim74@gmail.com
- You can download some of programs in https://jykim74.tistory.com/category/Software
